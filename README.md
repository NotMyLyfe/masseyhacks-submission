# COVID Data (Working title)
This project aims to use the latest statistics sourced from [an API](https://covid19api.com/) referencing Johns Hopkins CSSE for presentation on a website and Discord bot.

## Our Website
THe website will have a basic overview of covid on the front page. Additionally, there is a page that finds the country you're in and tells you your local health agency.

## The Discord Bot
This Discord bot will send COVID data in a conviniently packaged embed message. This makes it easily integratable into the casual chatting experience.

### Bot Commands
c!data <country>:
retrives data from the api, including active cases, serious cases, total new cases today, total recovered, and total deaths.

c!help:
help command

### Side Note
We were not able to set up our Domain.com domain ([covidstats.tech](https://covidstats.tech)) in time, as DNS records have to update.
